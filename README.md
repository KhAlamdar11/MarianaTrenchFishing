# MarianaTrenchFishing
A fishing game based on SDL2.0 and developed in C++. 
The game is divided into 4 stages:

* Stage 1: Catch fish by throwing the hook.
* Stage 2: A shark appears that attacks the boat. Jump boat to save it, as the boat has limited lives. Keep hitting head of the shark until it dies.
* Stage 3: Two sharks appear. Jump boat to avoid attacks and hit the head of sharks with the hook.
* Stage 4: A dragon appears. Figure out how to deal with this beast! Beware the blue fire, it is neiter water nor fire, but a kind of plasma that burns anything it touches to its core.

The game was developed as the final project of object oriented programming course at Habib University in Spring 2020.
